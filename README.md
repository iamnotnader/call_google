My friends and I used to work late at Google every night. And every night,
like clockwork, the lights in our area would go out precisely at 1am. Every
time that happened, we would have to call security and ask them to turn the 
lights on for us. This got frustrating after the first couple of times, so I
wrote this script to call security every night at 1am and have them turn the
lights on for us.
